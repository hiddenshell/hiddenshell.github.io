<br>Three types of scanning are involved:
<br><br>
<b>Port scanning:</b> This phase involves scanning the target for the information like open ports, Live systems, various services running on the host.
<br><br>
<b>Vulnerability Scanning:</b> Checking the target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Usually done with help of automated tools
<br><br>
<b>Network Mapping:</b> Finding the topology of network, routers, firewalls servers if any, and host information and drawing a network diagram with the available information. This map may serve as a valuable piece of information throughout the haking process.
